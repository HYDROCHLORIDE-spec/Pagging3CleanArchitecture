### Project Overview

This project implements a simple Android application following MVVM architecture and Clean Architecture principles to fetch and cache remote data. It utilizes modern Android libraries and tools to streamline network requests, dependency injection, data paging, image handling, and local storage management.

### Technology Stack

- **Retrofit**: Used for handling network requests and communication with remote APIs.
- **Hilt**: Dependency Injection framework for managing dependencies in a modular and efficient way.
- **Paging3**: Android Jetpack library for efficient paging of data from network and local storage.
- **Coil**: Image loading library for Android that simplifies the process of loading images from URLs.
- **Room**: Persistence library for local storage, used to cache data locally on the device.

### Features

- **MVVM Architecture**: Separates concerns by organizing code into Model, View, and ViewModel layers, promoting testability and maintainability.
- **Clean Architecture**: Implements separation of concerns with clear boundaries between entities, use cases, and data sources.
- **Remote Data Fetching**: Retrieves data from remote APIs using Retrofit, ensuring efficient and reliable network requests.
- **Local Data Caching**: Utilizes Room to cache fetched data locally, providing offline access and improved performance.
- **Pagination**: Implements paging functionality with Paging3 to load data incrementally and efficiently handle large datasets.
- **Image Loading**: Integrates Coil to effortlessly load and display images from URLs in the application's UI.
